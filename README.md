# Polo.QBE

https://c9x.me/compile/

This package seeks to provide a C#-esque representation of [QBE-IR](https://c9x.me/compile/). It can be used for code
generation of compilers.

## Projects using this package:
This package part of, and used within the [Polo](https://github.com/Zekiah-A/Polo) compiler project, as a means to convert
code written in the experimental, low-level language, *Mint* into a QBE IR representation.
